## Running Redis as a Service

Run install_redis.cmd as Administrator

you also can use the following command and manage redis service:

*--service-install*

This must be the first argument on the redis-server command line. Arguments after this are passed in the order they occur to Redis when the service is launched. The service will be configured as Autostart and will be launched as "NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService". Upon successful installation a success message will be displayed and Redis will exit.

This command does not start the service.

For instance:

redis-server --service-install redis.windows.conf --loglevel verbose

Uninstalling the Service
------------------------

*--service-uninstall*

This will remove the Redis service configuration information from the registry. Upon successful uninstallation a success message will be displayed and Redis will exit.

This does command not stop the service.

For instance:

redis-server --service-uninstall

Starting the Service
--------------------

*--service-start*

This will start the Redis service. Upon successful start, a success message will be displayed and Redis will begin running.

For instance:

redis-server --service-start

Stopping the Service
--------------------

*--service-stop*

This will stop the Redis service. Upon successful termination a success message will be displayed and Redis will exit.

For instance:

redis-server --service-stop

Naming the Service
------------------

*--service-name **name***

This optional argument may be used with any of the preceding commands to set the name of the installed service. This argument should follow the service-install, service-start, service-stop or service-uninstall commands, and precede any arguments to be passed to Redis via the service-install command.

The following would install and start three separate instances of Redis as a service:

redis-server --service-install --service-name redisService1 redis.conf

redis-server --service-start --service-name redisService1

The following would stop and uninstall three separate instances of Redis as a service:

redis-server --service-stop --service-name redisService1
redis-server --service-uninstall --service-name redisService1
